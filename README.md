# Face-detection

Face detection is a computer technology that determines the location and size of a human face in digital images. Given an image, the goal of facial recognition is to determine whether there are any faces and return the bounding box of each detected face (see object detection).

here, we are Implementing face detection with OpenCV and Haar Cascades.
